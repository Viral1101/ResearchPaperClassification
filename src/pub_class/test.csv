420,"The authors studied 10 patients (mean age 15 years 6 months) with localized developmental gyral disorder detected by MRI. There were two groups of major malformations. Seven patients (group 1) had unilateral 'macrogyric-like' insulo-opercular changes, one of whom died early in life and had extensive microgyria. The six others had mental retardation and epilepsy, three of whom had focal neurological signs. Age at onset of epilepsy varied greatly. Clinical and EEG data suggested a wider cerebral involvement than recognized on MRI. The remaining three patients (group 2) had abnormal gyri of variable topography and extension, with bulging grey matter and ventricular deformity. One had mental retardation, another had neurological signs. All had intractable complex partial seizures and focal EEG anomalies correlating with the MRI lesion site, pointing to a well-defined epileptogenic zone. No clinical or EEG evidence of significant malformation in the remaining brain tissue was observed. Ablative surgery was beneficial for one patient; focal cortical dysplasia was the pathological substrate.",Electroencephalography
454,"Drosophila affinidisjuncta and Drosophila hawaiiensis are closely related species that display distinct tissue-specific expression patterns for their homologous alcohol dehydrogenase genes (Adh genes). In Drosophila melanogaster transformants, both genes are expressed at high levels in the larval and adult fat bodies, but the D. affinidisjuncta gene is expressed 10-50-fold more strongly in the larval and adult midguts and Malpighian tubules. The present study reports the mapping of cis-acting sequences contributing to the regulatory differences between these two genes in transformants. Chimeric genes were constructed and introduced into the germ line of D. melanogaster. Stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns were determined by measuring steady-state RNA levels in larvae and adults. Three portions of the promoter region make distinct contributions to the tissue-specific regulatory differences between the native genes. Sequences immediately upstream of the distal promoter have a strong effect in the adult Malpighian tubules, while sequences between the two promoters are relatively important in the larval Malpighian tubules. A third gene segment, immediately upstream of the proximal promoter, influences levels of the proximal Adh transcript in all tissues and developmental stages examined, and largely accounts for the regulatory difference in the larval and adult midguts. However, these as well as other sequences make smaller contributions to various aspects of the tissue-specific regulatory differences. In addition, some chimeric genes display aberrant RNA levels for the whole organism, suggesting close physical association between sequences involved in tissue-specific regulatory differences and those important for Adh expression in the larval and adult fat bodies.",Genes
457,"Through enhancer detection screens we have isolated 14 insertions in an essential gene that is expressed in embryonic sensory mother cells (SMC), in most cells of the mature embryonic peripheral nervous system (PNS), and in glial cells of the PNS and the central nervous system (CNS). Embryos homozygote for amorphic alleles die, but show no obvious defects in their cuticle, PNS or CNS. The gene has been named couch potato (cpo) because several insertional alleles alter adult behavior. Homozygous hypomorphic cpo flies recover slowly from ether anaesthesia, show aberrant flight behavior, fail to move toward light and do not exhibit normal negative behavior. However, the flies are able to groom and walk, and some are able to fly when prodded, indicating that not all processes required for behavior are severely affected. A molecular analysis shows that the 14 insertions are confined to a few hundred nucleotides which probably contain key regulatory sequences of the gene. The orientation of these insertions and their position within this DNA fragment play an important role in the couch potato phenotype. In situ hybridization to whole mount embryos suggest that some insertions affect the levels of transcription of cpo in most cells in which it is expressed.",Genes
803,"The range of optimal fluoride intake for adults, 1.5 to 4 mg per day, was adjusted for children and adolescents aged 1 to 19 by relating these limits to body weight and energy intake. Limits related to weight agreed well with the usually recommended ranges for supplemented fluorides. However, for children up to 6 years of age limits related to energy intake were twice as high as those related to body weight. These differences diminished with increasing age and were small between 16 and 19 years of age. New conservative limits were based on an interval for adults ranging from 1.45 to 2.9 mg fluoride per day. The new age-adjusted limits were compatible with most current recommendations.",Aging
1155,"Activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger following isosmotic and hyperosmotic stimuli was investigated in an osteoblast cell line (RCJ 1.20). The pH dependence of the transporter activity was studied under conditions of abolished proton gradient (pHi = pHo) across the membrane. The isotonic response is Na+o dependent, increases towards higher pH-values, displaying a sigmoidal dependence on pHi = o (Hill coefficient approximately 1.8) and is controlled by pHo. The greater than first order dependence on pH suggests that H+o inhibits the exchange beyond the rate expected from competition with the Na+o alone. This may be due to the existence of an external H+ regulatory site with a negative cooperative effect on the intra- or extracellular transport site. The hyperosmotic activation is Na+o independent, parallels the sigmoidal pH dependence of the isosmotic stimulus (Hill coefficient approximately 2.0) and is mediated through an increase of the Vmax without a change in the intracellular proton sensitivity.",Hydrogen-Ion Concentration
1359,"Hippocampal rhythmical slow activity (RSA) can be elicited by stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation. All classes of anxiolytic drug so far tested reduce the frequency of this RSA. Anxiolytic barbiturates and benzodiazepines, as opposed to compounds such as buspirone, are thought to act as receptor agonists of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In the present study muscimol (a GABAA receptor agonist) and baclofen (a GABAB receptor agonist) were injected into freely moving rats. Baclofen produced a dose-related decrease in frequency of RSA in the range 1 to 9 mg/kg i.p. and abolished RSA at 27 mg/kg. Muscimol produced an increase in RSA frequency with an inverted U-shaped dose response curve in the range 0.0001 to 1.0 mg/kg with maximal effect at 0.001 mg/kg. The effects of classical anxiolytic drugs in the present test resemble those of the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen more than they resemble those of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol but it is possible that they are acting via GABA systems which employ low rather than high affinity GABAA receptors or through some transmitter system other than GABA.",Electroencephalography
1386,"The bovine gene encoding the type C atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptor was isolated and characterized. The gene appears to exist as a single copy in the haploid genome and is comprised of eight exons distributed over more than 85 kilobases. The transcription start site was identified by primer extension and ribonuclease protection assay. A ""TATA"" box-like sequence was found just upstream of the start site (at position -32); however, no CAAT box was apparent. Exon boundaries of the ANP receptor gene correlated well with the functional domain boundaries of the receptor protein; for example, exon 1 contains coding information for a large proportion of the ANP-binding domain and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are encoded by separate exons, namely by exon 7 and exon 8, respectively. These structural features suggest that the organization of the ANP receptor gene reflects the domain structure of the receptor.",Genes
1701,"Recombinant Oka varicella vaccine expressing hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBs) was constructed by inserting the HBs gene into the viral thymidine kinase (TK) gene and was examined for its immunogenicity in guinea-pigs. The HBs gene encoding 25 amino acids of preS2 and the whole of the S region was inserted into the TK gene of the cloned plasmid. The chimeric plasmid DNA and Oka varicella vaccine DNA were cotransfected and recombinant virus was isolated after immunofluorescence screening using a monoclonal antibody to HBs and a fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. Expression of viral HBs was detected in the cytoplasm of infected cells and was stable over several repeated passages in vitro. The recombinant virus expressed 26K and 30K HBs molecules in infected cells and the culture supernatant contained 30K and 35K HBs molecules. HBs was purified at a density of 1.20 g/ml from the culture supernatants. The recombinant virus induced an antibody response to HBs as well as to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in guinea-pigs, and the antibody titre to HBs was comparable to that induced by a recombinant HBs subunit vaccine produced in yeast. Thus a single dose of live recombinant Oka varicella vaccine could induce good immunity to VZV and HBs. The recombinant Oka varicella vaccine expressing HBs may be a good candidate for a combined HBV and VZV vaccine.",Antibody Formation
1707,"Several vaccinia virus (VV)-varicella-zoster virus (VZV) recombinants expressing glycoprotein I (gpI) of VZV were isolated from the Prague strain of VV. One of these, v46, was inoculated intraperitoneally into mice. Groups of mice were bled 4 and 8 weeks later and their sera were examined for anti-VZV and anti-VV antibodies by ELISA. At 4 weeks, all mice inoculated with the three largest virus doses (10(7), 10(6) and 10(5) p.f.u.), and at 8 weeks all mice inoculated with the four highest virus doses (10(7), 10(6), 10(5), and 10(4) p.f.u.), had developed both anti-VV and anti-VZV antibodies. Antibodies were also detected in a high proportion of mice infected with lower doses of virus and in some instances VZV antibodies were present in the absence of VV antibodies. None of the animals inoculated in parallel with either a thymidine kinase-negative mutant of the original VV or diluent alone developed antibody reactive with VZV. The specificity of the reaction was assessed further by Western blotting using anti-gpI monoclonal antibodies as a positive control. Sera from animals immunized with v46 possessed antibody capable of neutralizing extracellular VZV in the presence of complement.",Antibody Formation
1836,"Thirty-three mentally normal children aged 4.5 to 11 years with hyperdynamia were examined for their EEG. In the profile of functional asymmetry (PFA) detected by the leading hand and eye, a considerable portion, as compared to normals, was made up of ambidextrous children with no left-handers. Depending on the pattern of biopotentials, two types were distinguished in the EEG. Each of the type covered children with different PFA. The cross-correlations inside and interhemispheric relations were different in children with different PFA and depended on the EEG type. The children with hyperdynamia were shown to have the weakening of the intrahemispheric correlations by the alpha rhythm together with their potentiation according to the beta rhythms, a decrease of positive interhemispheric asymmetries, and a great number of negative asymmetries.",Electroencephalography
1902,"An average of three (range 0-22) perfect matches for 65 patients could be found in 1490 filed HLA-typed donors. It could increase to 8.7 (0-45) if strong cross-reactive antigens were added. Three methods of platelet crossmatching, i.e, lymphocytotoxicity test (LCT), platelet suspension immunofluorescence test (PSIFT) and solid phase red cell adherence test (SPRCA), were used to search for compatible donors. Forty episodes of apheresis platelet transfusion were evaluated in seven patients. Using one-hour posttransfusional corrected count of increment (CCI), greater than 7500 microliters as a guideline to assess the reliability of these three methods, we found that the efficiency of PSIFT, LCT and SPRCA were 67.5%, 97.5% and 97.5% respectively. Retrospectively, we did the HLA-A, B typing of those matched donors. There was no significant difference in CCI among different HLA match grades. The concordance of LCT and SPRCA was 100%, indicating that all the antibodies were of HLA specificity and there was no platelet specific antibody. We concluded that HLA donor-file and platelet crossmatching technique could be used together in selecting suitable donors for alloimmunized patients.",Antibody Formation
1945,"The five major antioxidants enzymes, cytochrome oxidase (COX), GSH, and GSSG, and endogenous and in vitro stimulated lipid peroxidation (TBA-RS) were assayed in the lung of old (28 months) and young (9 months) adult rats due to the almost total absence of data of this kind in this tissue, which is normally exposed to relatively high pO2 throughout life. Catalase, selenium (Se)-dependent GSH peroxidase (GPx), GSH reductase, GSH, GSSG, GSSG/GSH, and in vivo and in vitro TBA-RS showed similar values in old and young animals. The decrease observed for non Se-dependent GPx disappeared when the values were expressed in relation to COX activity. Only superoxide dismutase showed a clear decrease when referred both to protein and COX activity. These results suggest that lung aging is not accelerated in old age due to a decrease in the antioxidant capacity of the tissue. Nevertheless, they are compatible with a continuous damage of the lung tissue by free radicals throughout the life span.",Aging
1951,"Mice of certain strains are highly sensitive to development of a severe immunodeficiency disease following inoculation as adults with LP-BM5 murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) whereas others are extremely resistant. These strain-dependent differences in response to infection have been shown to be genetically determined with resistance to disease being, in general, associated with homozygosity for Fv-1n and H-2 haplotypes a and d and sensitivity with homozygosity for Fv-1b and other H-2 haplotypes including b, s, and q. The Fv-1b, H-2r strain RIIIS/J (RIIIS) was found to be highly resistant to disease even though B10.RIII(71NS)/J (B10.RIII), also H-2r, was very sensitive, thus excluding a role for H-2 in the resistance of RIIIS. The characteristics of RIIIS resistance were evaluated in studies of infected (B10.RIII x RIIIS) F1, F2 and reciprocal backcross mice. Resistance to disease was shown to be semidominant and determined by more than one gene, although a preponderant influence of a single gene was suggested. Studies of segregating populations showed that resistance was not associated with or linked to polymorphisms of the V beta complex or genes in proximity to the Emv-2 locus on chromosome 8. However, there was almost complete concordance between absence of disease in infected mice and inhibition of ecotropic virus spread. These results demonstrate that genes other than Fv-1 or H-2 can profoundly influence the development of retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency and replication of ecotropic viruses.",Genes
2001,"A series of genomic clones containing DNA that encodes the chicken gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor beta 4 subunit have been isolated. These have been restriction mapped and partially sequenced to determine the structural organization and the size of the beta 4-subunit gene. This gene, which comprises nine exons, spans more than 65 kb. The organization of the chicken GABAA receptor beta 4-subunit gene has been compared to that of the murine GABAA receptor delta-subunit gene and to those of the genes that encode other members of the ligand-gated ion-channel superfamily, namely muscle and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Although the positions of the intron/exon boundaries of GABAA receptor subunit genes are seen to be highly conserved, there are significant differences between the genes that encode GABAA receptor and AChR subunits. These results are discussed in relation to the proposal that this superfamily of ligand-gated ion-channel receptor genes arose by duplication of an ancestral receptor gene.",Genes
2742,"We investigated the levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (r-ANP) gene expression in the atria of rats aged 2-3 months and 14-18 months. In the meantime, we studied the effects of ginsenosides on r-ANP gene expression by determining the content of ANP messenger ribonucleic acid (r-ANP-mRNA). Male and female rats were abdominally injected aqueous solution of ginsenoside (prepared from ginseng stems and leaves (G-SL) and ginseng roots (G-R) 50 mg/kg body weight, once a day, for 7 days. Atrial total RNA was extracted by cold phenol method. The specificity and relative contents of r-ANP-mRNA were determined by using Northern blot and Dot blot hybridization respectively with alpha-32P-labeled r-ANP-cDNA probe. The results showed that the r-ANF-mRNA levels in male and female rats at the age of 14-18 months were about 15% and 60% of those in male and female rats at the age of 2-3 months. G-SL and G-R increased r-ANP-mRNA contents in male rats at the age of 14-18 months by 1 fold and 1.7 folds respectively; whereas they decreased r-ANP-mRNA contents in male rats at the age of 2-3 months. No apparent effects of ginsenosides on ANP gene expression was observed in female rats. These results showed that ANP gene expression is more declined in elder rats and ginseng has certain effects in the aspect of heart endocrine to combat decrepitude.",Aging
2913,"Insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) initiate their metabolic, growth, and differentiation effects through binding to the insulin receptor and the IGF-I receptor, two members of the tyrosine kinase family of receptors. To study the role of these peptides and receptors in early development, we used the polymerase chain reaction and embryo-derived RNA to generate partial cDNA sequences of the insulin receptor and IGF-I receptor from the amphibian Xenopus laevis. Three unique tyrosine kinase-related sequences were obtained. Two of the nucleotide sequences, XTK 1a and XTK 1b, corresponded to peptide that share 92% amino acid identity, and each is 89% identical to the human insulin receptor. The third sequence, XTK 2, corresponds to a peptide that has 92% amino acid identity with the human IGF-I receptor but only 80% identity with XTK 1a and XTK 1b. On the basis of these similarities, the pattern of conserved amino acids, and the tetraploid nature of the Xenopus genome, we suggest that XTK 1a and XTK 1b most likely represent the product of two different nonallelic insulin receptor genes, while XTK 2 may be one of the probable two Xenopus IGF-I receptor genes. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and gene-specific hybridization, expression of the three XTK sequences was detected in the oocyte, unfertilized egg, and embryos through gastrulation, neurulation, and tailbud stages. Competition binding assays with Xenopus membrane preparations demonstrated insulin receptors and IGF-I receptors in older tadpoles. IGF-I receptors were also present in oocytes, eggs, and gastrula embryos. By contrast, insulin binding was present but atypical in oocytes and was barely detected in eggs and gastrula embryos. The expression of receptors for insulin and IGF-I in early Xenopus embryos and their apparent distinct developmental regulation suggest that these molecules and their ligands may be important in early Xenopus development.",Genes
2990,"The identification of helper T (TH)-cell subsets has greatly improved understanding of the regulation of immune effector functions. In addition to controlling humoral and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses, these subsets crossregulate by secreting mutually inhibitory cytokines. In this review, Tim Mosmann and Kevin Moore examine these phenomena and in particular the role of interleukin 10, a cytokine secreted by TH2 cells that inhibits TH1-cell function.",Antibody Formation
3029,"Expression of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene is tightly regulated in a tissue- and development-specific manner. Accumulation of MPO messenger RNA (mRNA) occurs only at the late myeloblastic and promyelocytic stages of myeloid differentiation and is negligible at other stages of myeloid development and in other tissues. The goal of our studies was to begin to understand the events that occur to control MPO gene expression during normal granulocytopoiesis. Chromatin structure of the MPO gene was evaluated by DNase I treatment of isolated nuclei and Southern blot analysis. No detectable DNase I hypersensitive sites were found in the region of the MPO gene in non-myeloid cells. One site was present in the 5' upstream region in myeloid cells that are developmentally too immature to transcribe MPO. Three sites of hypersensitivity in the regions of the putative MPO promoter and upstream region occurred in MPO-expressing promyelocytes. These sites were markedly reduced in terminally differentiated, non-expressing myeloid cells. Analysis of DNA methylation of the MPO gene using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes showed that the gene was highly methylated in non-myeloid cells. Stepwise demethylation occurred in myeloid cells developmentally too immature to transcribe MPO. Maximal demethylation in the 5' gene region occurred in MPO-expressing promyelocytes. This methylation pattern did not change in terminally differentiated, MPO non-expressing myeloid cells. A somatic hybrid cell formed by fusion of HL-60 (MPO-expressing cells) and PUT (MPO non-expressing lymphoid cells) extinguished expression of MPO and showed a chimeric pattern of MPO gene methylation, suggesting that demethylation is necessary but not sufficient for expression of the MPO gene. Our studies show that demethylation and DNase I hypersensitivity of the MPO gene were associated with a tissue-dependent potential for MPO gene expression that preceded the developmental ability to express MPO mRNA.",Genes
3260,"A cDNA representing a unique Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase has been cloned and sequenced from a rat brain cDNA library. This enzyme, expressed in brain, testis, and spleen, is only 32% identical to the various isoforms of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. The sequence of the COOH-terminal 169 amino acids is identical to that of a previously described male germ cell-specific calmodulin-binding protein called calspermin (T. Ono, G.R. Slaughter, R.G. Cook, and A.R. Means, J. Biol. Chem. 264:2081-2087, 1989). This identity extends to the nucleic acid sequence and includes all but the first 130 nucleotides of the calspermin cDNA. Primer extension and sequence of a genomic fragment containing the unique calspermin sequence reveals that this mRNA is derived from the kinase transcription unit by germ cell-specific use of a unique exon. In situ hybridization was used to demonstrate that both kinase and calspermin mRNAs are expressed during spermatogenesis. The kinase mRNA is first detected in early meiotic cells and declines to a low level in haploid cells. Calspermin mRNA first appears in pachytene primary spermatocytes and continues to increase as cells complete meiosis and undergo terminal differentiation. These results show that differential utilization of a single gene during spermatogenesis is used to generate mRNAs that encode proteins with distinct functions.",Genes
3270,"CG is encoded by separate alpha- and beta-subunit genes. Expression of both genes is stimulated by cAMP, but the kinetics of activation are different, with cAMP stimulation of the alpha gene preceding that of the beta gene. The cAMP response element (CRE) in the alpha gene contains a palindromic DNA sequence, TGACGTCA, that binds the transcription factor CREB, a nuclear phosphoprotein that is activated by protein kinase-A. Previously, detailed characterization of a CRE in the CG beta gene had been difficult due to low levels of expression in transfected cells. In this study the 5'-flanking sequence of the CG beta gene was fused to a sensitive luciferase (LUC) reporter gene, allowing delineation of a CG beta CRE in transient expression assays performed in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells. The full-length CG beta promoter, -3700 to 362 basepairs (bp), was stimulated 8- to 14-fold by treatment with 1 mM 8-bromo-cAMP. Analyses of a series of deletion mutants in the CG beta promoter demonstrated that -311 CG beta LUC retained nearly complete cAMP stimulation, but deletion to -187 bp eliminated cAMP responsiveness. Overlapping DNA fragments between -311 and -30 bp were fused to a heterologous promoter (-99 alpha LUC) to further define the locations of basal elements and CREs. Basal expression required a combination of at least two distinct elements between -311 and -30 bp, whereas cAMP responsiveness was conferred by sequences between -311 and -202 bp. Shorter DNA sequences within this region were insufficient for cAMP stimulation, suggesting that more than one element may be required. DNase-I footprinting and gel mobility shift studies demonstrated at least three distinct protein-binding sites within the CG beta CRE sequence. Recombinant CREB (expressed in E. coli) did not bind to these sites, and they share no sequence homology with the alpha gene CRE, indicating that a cAMP-responsive transcription factor other than CREB interacts with the CG beta promoter.",Genes
4133,"We have sequenced HFL1 from D. melanogaster, the only cloned hobo element shown to have transposase activity. The 2959 bp HFL1 sequence predicts a 2.0 kb open reading frame (ORF1) with substantial amino acid similarity to the transposases of Activator (Ac) from maize (Zea mays) and Tam3 from snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus). Mutational analysis of a C-terminal region of ORF1 conserved with Ac and Tam3 indicates that it is essential for hobo transposase activity. This is an example of extensive amino acid sequence identity between short inverted repeat elements in different kingdoms. We discuss the possibility that the conservation of hobo, Ac, and Tam3 transposases represents an example of horizontal transmission of genetic information between plants and animals.",Genes
4143,"DNA from 61 unrelated patients with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) was examined for mutations in three genes (DP1, SRP19, and DP2.5) located within a 100 kb region deleted in two of the patients. The intron-exon boundary sequences were defined for each of these genes, and single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons from DP2.5 identified four mutations specific to APC patients. Each of two aberrant alleles contained a base substitution changing an amino acid to a stop codon in the predicted peptide; the other mutations were small deletions leading to frameshifts. Analysis of DNA from parents of one of these patients showed that his 2 bp deletion is a new mutation; furthermore, the mutation was transmitted to two of his children. These data have established that DP2.5 is the APC gene.",Genes
4426,"We reported a female infant with early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME). She was diagnosed on the basis of clinical and laboratory features including electroencephalographic and magnetic resonance image (MRI) findings. Frequent erratic myoclonic seizures appeared since 28 days after birth and EEG showed a typical suppression-burst pattern. We administered a high-dose pyridoxal phosphate, thyrotropin-releasing hormone analogue (TRH), and then ACTH, but could not control the seizures at all. With seizure types, we observed the change from erratic myoclonus to tonic spasms in series, with concomitant EEG change to hypsarhythmia at the age of 6 months. Cranial MRI revealed delayed myelination in the white matter but no brain malformation. We administered ACTH to her again and succeeded partially in the decrease of the seizure frequency, and significantly in the improvement of EEG findings. It is supposed that the responsiveness to ACTH treatment changed with age as the seizure patterns developed from erratic myoclonus to tonic spasm.",Electroencephalography
4461,"HL-60/AMSA is a human leukemia cell line that is 50- to 100-fold more resistant to the cytotoxic actions of the topoisomerase II-reactive intercalator amsacrine than is its drug-sensitive HL-60 parent line. Previously, we have shown that the topoisomerase II from HL-60/AMSA is also resistant to inhibition by amsacrine and other intercalating agents. We therefore sought the molecular basis for the resistance of the topoisomerase II of HL-60/AMSA and, by inference, of the HL-60/AMSA line itself. We report the cloning and sequencing of the topoisomerase II genes from both the sensitive and resistant leukemia cell lines using polymerase chain reaction technology. We have identified a single base change associated with the drug-resistant form of topoisomerase II. This mutation is present in both cloned HL-60/AMSA complementary DNA and extracted HL-60/AMSA genomic DNA. A rapid assay for this mutation in clinical samples has been developed and applied to the DNA of cells from both normal volunteers and leukemia patients. Thus far, the HL-60/AMSA genotype has not been identified in the cells from any individual, suggesting that this genotype is indeed a mutation and not an allelic form of topoisomerase II. The novel assay developed will allow a rapid search for the prevalence of this mutation in clinical samples from patients with leukemia who have relapsed following intercalator therapy.",Genes
4483,"Langendorff preparations of Sprague-Dawley rat hearts were perfused with calcium-free Krebs solution of pH 7.48 (control), 7.26 (acidosis) or 7.69 (alkalosis) containing either adrenaline or potassium. The responses of the force of contraction, coronary perfusion pressure and heart rate to graded doses of calcium preceded by a single dose of verapamil were measured. Contractile responsiveness to calcium was reduced during acidosis in both adrenaline- and potassium-stimulated hearts but was increased or reduced during alkalosis with adrenaline- or potassium stimulation, respectively. The efficacy of verapamil as a calcium antagonist increased during acidosis or alkalosis in both adrenaline- and potassium-stimulated hearts. In conclusion, acidosis or alkalosis inhibits potassium-stimulated contractions of the heart and enhances the effects of verapamil on potassium- and adrenaline-mediated contractions. Acidosis inhibits and alkalosis enhances adrenaline-stimulated contractions.",Hydrogen-Ion Concentration
4545,"The effects of vaccination of sheep with a recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) expressing the bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) envelope glycoprotein (gp60) were studied by determining BLV titres in peripheral blood leukocytes after vaccination and challenge. The proliferation of BLV was suppressed markedly, not only when rVV was inoculated prior to challenge with BLV, but also when it was inoculated after challenge. These results indicate that vaccination with rVV induces protective immunity that can suppress the growth of BLV in carrier animals. Since rVV induced a strong anti-BLV delayed-type hypersensitivity response without producing detectable levels of binding or neutralizing antibodies, and there was no apparent correlation between the humoral immune response and BLV proliferation, a cell-mediated immune response was assumed to play a major role in protective immunity.","Immunity, Cellular"
4856,"Cardiac membranes from 26-, 52- and 104-week-old Wistar rats were used to investigate the age-related alterations in the beta-adrenergic receptor-adenylyl cyclase system. The densities and affinities of beta-adrenoceptors did not change with aging. There were no significant changes in the total amount of stimulatory G-protein (Gs), and in Gs activity measured in a reconstitution assay using human platelet membranes. The major isoform of Gs alpha, however, changed from a 45,000 to 52,000 dalton peptide with aging. The total amount of pertussis toxin substrates (Gi2 and Go) decreased significantly with aging. This finding was supported by the fact that pertussis toxin-induced potentiation of adenylyl cyclase activity was markedly reduced in the aged group. The activity of catalytic protein assessed by forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was decreased at 104 weeks. On the other hand, GTP analogue-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was significantly potentiated in the same group. These results suggest that the decreased sensitivity to catecholamines observed in aged hearts is mainly due to a dysfunction of catalytic protein, and that decreased Gi activity partially compensates for this catalytic dysfunction.",Aging
5173,"The gene structure for S-100 beta subunit has been elucidated. The gene spans about 8 kbp and consists of 3 exons and 2 introns. The transcription initiation site was determined by an S1 nuclease mapping. The promoter region contains TATA-box-like and CAAT-box-like sequences. To examine the activity of the promoter sequence, a transfection of pS100 beta-lacZ fused gene to the cultured cells was carried out. C6 glioma cells showed a positive expression of beta-galactosidase. Gene-deletion experiments suggested the functional importance of the DNA fragment (22 bp) containing TATA-box-like and CAAT-box-like sequences. A factor protein that binds to the 100 bp DNA fragment containing the promoter sequence was specifically detected in the rat brain nuclear extract.",Genes
5217,"Immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the oral rhesus rotavirus vaccine (RRV) were assessed among 72 infants (6 weeks old) in Lahore, Pakistan, from August to December 1985. Special emphasis was placed on the possible interaction or interference caused by giving RRV at the time infants received their first polio immunization. RRV was given to the infants at the same time as diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). The immune response to RRV was assessed by plaque-reduction neutralization 3 weeks after immunization and serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA antibody levels to poliovirus type 1 were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after polio immunizations. Of the infants in the group given RRV with OPV, 50% had a two- to four-fold rise in neutralization titre against rotavirus, compared with 22% in the group given RRV with DTP and 20% in the group given RRV and IPV (P less than 0.05). Interference by live oral polio vaccination in the response to RRV seems unlikely. We observed no significant difference in rates of seroconversion of IgG antibodies to poliovirus type 1 among infants aged 18 and 21 weeks who received RRV and OPV (81%), RRV with delayed OPV (67%), or RRV and IPV (59%).

5247,"The effects of high and low extracellular pH (8.0 and 6.8) on the intracellular concentration of Ca2+, Na+, and H+ were measured in perfused Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells cast in agarose gel threads. Cytosolic free Ca2+ (Ca2+i) was measured with aequorin, while intracellular Na+ (Na+i) and H+ (Hi+ or pHi) were determined with the fluorescent indicators SBFI and BCECF, respectively. In addition, H+ secretion was assayed by the pH-stat method, and Na+ or Ca2+ fluxes were measured with 22Na or 45Ca, respectively. H+ secretion was significantly depressed by several experimental conditions that are known to inhibit the Na(+)-H+ antiporter: H+ secretion decreased 44% in the presence of 10(-5) M ethylisopropylamiloride, 49% in Na+o-free media, 44% in the presence of 10(-4) M ouabain, and 32% in the presence of 10(-4) M 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate. In addition, pHi decreased by 0.2 pH units in Na+o-free media. Finally, recovery from an intracellular acidosis evoked by 20 mM NH4Cl pulse required the presence of extracellular Na+. When the extracellular pH (pHo) was increased from 7.4 to 8.0, H+ secretion increased 58% from 17.5 to 27.7 nmol.min-1.mg protein-1 and Na+ influx increased 48%. As a result, pHi rose from 7.43 to 7.71 and Na+i increased from 15.6 to 19.7 mM. Finally, Ca2+i rose from 120 to 268 nM. These results suggest that the high pHo stimulated the Na(+)-H+ antiporter, and the subsequent rise in Na+i decreased the Na+ electrochemical potential, thereby activating the reverse mode of Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange (Ca2+ influx vs. Na+ efflux) which led to the rise in Ca2+i.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Hydrogen-Ion Concentration
5258,"We measured intracellular pH (pHi) of single epithelial cells in situ in the urinary bladder epithelium using microspectrofluorometry and the cytoplasmically trapped pH-sensitive fluorophore, 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)- carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). The resting pHi was 7.21 +/- 0.03 (n = 40 bladders, 489 cells) in pH 7.8 bathing solutions, indicating that H+ is not passively distributed across the plasma membrane and is extruded against its electrochemical gradient. Whereas exposure to hypercapnia (5% CO2 saturation) reversibly decreased pHi, mucosally added 20 mM NH4+ reversibly increased pHi. Recovery from the NH4+ effect was slow and lacked an acid-load pHi undershoot; this is interpreted as suggesting significant NH4+ permeability. Recovery from hypercapnic acidosis was blocked by mucosally added amiloride, indicating that apical Na(+)-H+ exchange is involved in pHi regulation. Addition of 0.5 mM NH4+ to the basolateral side when the mucosal side was bathed in mock urine (2 mM NaCl) significantly increased undirectional mucosal-to-serosal Na+ flux, and the increase was blocked by mucosally added amiloride. We conclude that an apically located Na(+)-H+ exchange is important in pHi regulation and may also accept NH4+ as the counterion for Na+.",Hydrogen-Ion Concentration
5378,"During reperfusion with pH 7.2 media after 55 min of ischemia, the recovery of developed tension (DT) and the maximal resting tension (RT) of the isolated right ventricular wall of rats were 58.8 +/- 6.5 and 201 +/- 20%, respectively, of the preischemic values. DT and RT in the ventricular wall perfused with pH 7.9 media for 6 min during reperfusion were 40 +/- 5.9 and 285 +/- 13%, respectively, of the preischemic values (P less than .05 vs. pH 7.2 group). The Na(+)-H+ exchange inhibitor, 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride (DMA), effectively antagonized the detrimental effect of pH 7.9 media. A pH 6.5 media inhibited DT recovery and the rise in RT in the first 6 min of reperfusion. Subsequent reperfusion with pH 7.2 media resulted in cardiac dysfunction similar to that observed when reperfused at pH 7.2 only. Cellular Na+ and Ca++ were significantly elevated after 6 min of reperfusion at pH 7.2. Na+ and Ca++ levels were increased further if reperfusion was carried out at pH 7.9. Inclusion of 20 microM DMA during reperfusion at 7.9 significantly reduced cellular Na+ and Ca++. Creatine phosphokinase activity in the coronary effluent rose significantly during reperfusion at pH 7.2 and this was exacerbated if the reperfusion pH was 7.9. DMA treatment during reperfusion could significantly inhibit this elevation. The data lend further support for an important role of Na(+)-H+ exchange in the development of ischemia-reperfusion injury.",Hydrogen-Ion Concentration
5562,"The hypotrichous ciliate, Euplotes eurystomus, contains both a transcriptionally inactive micronucleus (MIC) and a transcriptionally active macronucleus (MAC) in the same cell. MAC DNA is small (0.5-20 kb), linear and highly amplified. Each DNA fragment consists of two telomeres, a single coding region, and the necessary control elements to regulate gene transcription and replication. The polyubiquitin gene consists of 898 bp, plus 28 bp of double-stranded and 14 bases of single-stranded DNA of the telomeric repeat G4T4 at each end. The coding region exists as three copies of the ubiquitin gene (690 bp) fused in a head-to-tail arrangement as in other organisms. The stop codon is TAA, as in other Euplotes genes, and is not the rare glutamine codon used in most other ciliates. The 3' nontranslated region contains two presumptive poly(A) addition sites; the 5' nontranslated region possesses two putative TATA boxes, several imperfect direct and inverted repeats, and a possible origin of replication. Nucleosome positioning studies reveal four tightly packed nucleosomes and a non-nucleosomal area containing the probable 5' control region as well as part of the coding region. The 5' area does not contain any DNAse I hypersensitive sites. Although the telomeres are protected from exonuclease digestion, they are not as well protected as Oxytricha telomeres against endonucleases and cleavage by methidium propyl Fe2+ EDTA.",Genes

With the laser pulses applied to the foot only ultralate, but no late potentials were observed, indicating intact C-fibres, but disturbed A delta-fibres.

6371,"By immunizing inbred mice with purified replication-competent, defective virus particles, or an admixture of the two, differential effects on the cellular immune system have been uncovered. Defective virus, exemplified by the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) defective interfering particle (DI 0.33), induced in BALB/c mice low levels of proliferating, IL-2 secreting, and cytolytic Ag-specific T lymphocytes. This was not caused by a dominant suppressor cell response, or by a failure to stimulate lymphokine-secreting cells, but appeared to reflect a reduced efficiency of priming as compared with standard virus. Mice primed with a mixture of wt and DI virus showed reduced proliferation compared with mice primed with wt virus. When histocompatible target cells were sensitized by pure DI particles, they were neither recognized nor lysed by CD8+ CTL. Cells co-infected with wt and DI particles were not as readily lysed by CD8+ CTL as cells infected by VSV alone. The extent of this reduction was dependent on the concentration of DI particles. This suggests that DI particles may have prevented the proper presentation of endogenously synthesized Ag for recognition by CD8+ CTL. Metabolic labeling studies indicated that the presence of DI particles suppressed the synthesis of viral proteins in dually infected cells. However, CD4+ T lymphocyte clones recognized and efficiently lysed histocompatible Ia+ cells infected with DI particles alone or co-infected with replication-competent and defective virus.","Immunity, Cellular"

In contrast, P. gingivalis showed a reverse relationship to subject age with highest prevalence and concentration levels in older subjects (30 years and older) compared to subjects in younger age groups. Statistical testing of these relationships were highly significant. (P less than 0.0001).",Aging
6626,"A mutational analysis of the rat cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (RCO4) promoter region revealed the presence of a major control element consisting of a tandemly repeated pair of binding sites for a nuclear factor from HeLa cells. This factor was designated NRF-2 (nuclear respiratory factor 2) because a functional recognition site was also found in the human ATP synthase beta-subunit gene. Deletion or site-directed point mutations of the NRF-2 binding sites in the RCO4 promoter resulted in substantial loss of transcriptional activity, and synthetic oligomers of the NRF-2 binding sites from both genes stimulated a heterologous promoter when cloned in cis. NRF-2 binding and transcriptional activation required a purine-rich core sequence, GGAA. This motif is characteristic of the recognition site for a family of activators referred to as ETS domain proteins because of the similarity within their DNA-binding domains to the ets-1 proto-oncogene product. NRF-2 recognized an authentic Ets-1 site within the Moloney murine sarcoma virus long terminal repeat, and this site was able to compete for NRF-2 binding to the RCO4 promoter sequence. In addition, a single polypeptide of 55 kDa was detected following cross-linking of a partially purified NRF-2 fraction to RCO4, the human ATP synthase beta subunit, or Moloney murine sarcoma virus binding sites. However, in contrast to Ets-1, which appears to be exclusive to lymphoid tissues, NRF-2 has the broad tissue distribution expected of a regulator of respiratory chain expression.",Genes

7090,"An experimental stable model of an in vitro turtle brain (Chrysemys d'orbigny) was developed in order to compare electrographic activity (EEG) with transmembrane potentials. Two preparations were used: a whole intact hemisphere and a whole open hemisphere. The latter permitted easier impalement of cortical neurons through the ependymal surface. The EEG characteristics were similar to those described in turtles in vivo. The EEG was nonrhythmic (rhythmicity coefficient less than 0.40). The power spectrum presented a high energy band between 1 and 3 Hz, decreasing progressively towards the higher frequencies. Total power of the EEG was one order of magnitude greater than the system noise. Random large amplitude sharp waves (22-300 microV, 500-1,900 ms) were recorded spontaneously. Hypoxia produced an increase in frequency and amplitude of the large sharp waves, without modification of either EEG background activity or membrane potentials. Physostigmine provoked the disappearance of the large sharp waves, an effect reversed by atropine. The addition of TTX to the medium provoked the abolition of the EEG, although spikes and plateaus determined by Ca2+ conductances persisted. The power spectra band of maximum relative potency was 0.8-2.5 Hz for both EEG and slow membrane potentials.",Electroencephalography
7470,"The rat gastric H+/K(+)-ATPase beta subunit gene was cloned, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The coding region is separated by 6 introns, whereas the related human Na+/K(+)-ATPase beta subunit gene was shown to have 5 introns (Lane, L.K., Shull, M.M., Whitmer, K.R., and Lingrel, J.B. (1989) Genomics 5, 445-453). The positions of introns 1, 2, and 5 of the two genes were the same. The similarities in intron/exon organizations and primary structures (30-40% identical residues) suggest that the beta subunit genes for H+/K(+)-ATPases were derived from a common ancestor. The upstream region of the rat H+/K(+)-ATPase beta subunit gene contains direct repeat sequences and palindromes, potential binding sites for RNA polymerase II and E4TF1, and CACCC box sequences. Gel retardation assay demonstrated that the stomach, but not other tissues (liver, brain, kidney, spleen, and lung), has a nuclear protein(s) capable of binding to the regions upstream of the potential RNA polymerase II binding sites (TATA box). The nuclear protein(s) are suggested to recognize three tandem GATAGC sequences and may be important for controlled transcription of the H+/K(+)-ATPase beta subunit gene in gastric parietal cells.",Genes
7473,"The first exon of the human thyrotropin-beta (hTSH beta) gene has been demonstrated in our laboratory to contain a major thyroid hormone inhibitory element. In order to characterize fully this element, we have performed a detailed functional and structural scanning mutational analysis of this element. Various -1192 to +37 (base pairs) bp fragments of the hTSH beta gene containing consecutive five deoxythymidine substitution mutations of the first exon were inserted into a luciferase reporter plasmid and transiently transfected into human embryonal cells (293) and stably transfected into rat pituitary cells (GH3). Two domains (domain 1 and 2) were identified by scanning mutations that were essential for function of the thyroid hormone inhibitory element: +3 to +13 bp and +28 to +37 bp. Biotinylated DNA fragments containing -12 to +43 bp of the hTSH beta gene and the identical scanning mutations demonstrate that in vitro synthesized c-erbA-beta binding is disrupted as much as 95% by mutations from -3 to +17 bp and to a lesser extent (20-30%) by mutations from +23 to +27 bp and from +33 to +43 bp. Domain 1 displayed a higher affinity for c-erbA-beta than domain 2 in avidin-biotin complex DNA-binding and gel-mobility assays. Using increasing amounts of in vitro synthesized c-erbA-beta, we were unable to demonstrate more than one protein-DNA complex in gel-mobility assays. However, using the avidin-biotin complex DNA-binding assay and the cross-linking reagent, 1,6-bismaleimidohexane, we were able to demonstrate thyroid hormone receptor dimer formation on domain 1 but not to any significant extent on domain 2. In conclusion, functional and DNA-binding studies suggest that the thyroid hormone receptor binds to two distinct regions in the first exon of the hTSH beta gene. The upstream site (domain 1) binds c-erbA-beta with higher affinity and is capable of binding c-erbA-beta as a dimer under some conditions, while the downstream site (domain 2) appears to bind a single molecule of c-erbA-beta with lower affinity. These results suggest that thyroid hormone receptor, binding to at least two sites in the first exon, act in conjunction to mediate T3 inhibition of hTSH beta expression.",Genes
7482,"Transcription of the gene for the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) (EC 4.1.1.32) (PEPCK) in the liver is regulated by many hormones including thyroid hormone (T3). In order to identify the elements in the promoter which are required for transcriptional induction by T3, we cotransfected a T3 receptor expression vector with a PEPCK-CAT reporter gene into HepG2 cells. Using vectors with deletions in the PEPCK promoter, we identified a single T3 response element (TRE) between positions -332 and -308. This element binds [125I]T3-labeled T3 receptor contained in nuclear extracts prepared from rat liver. Furthermore, the P3(I) element (-250 to -234), a previously described cis-sequence involved in mediating the induction of PEPCK gene transcription by cAMP, is also required for the T3 responsiveness of the promoter. In the absence of either the TRE or the P3(I) binding sites, no stimulation of transcription from the PEPCK promoter by T3 was observed, indicating that both elements are required for the T3 transcriptional regulation. Finally, a synergistic induction of PEPCK gene transcription by T3 and cAMP is described. This interaction requires both T3- and cAMP-responsive cis-acting elements.",Genes

Expression of the P1 and 3C genes in E. coli resulted in efficient synthesis and processing of the structural protein precursor and assembly into 70S empty capsids. This material reacted with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies which recognize only conformational epitopes and elicited a significant neutralizing antibody response in vaccinated guinea pigs. Expression of the P1 gene in E. coli resulted in synthesis of an insoluble product, whereas in insect cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus a soluble product was synthesized.

Corynebacterium kutscheri was isolated from nine hamsters, and regardless of the hamsters' ages, the organisms were most frequently isolated from the oral cavity (100%), esophagus (100%), cecal content (100%), and colon and rectum (88.9%). Isolation rates in the nasal cavity were 66.7%, followed by 55.5% in the trachea and 33.3% in the submaxillary lymph nodes.

The organisms were not isolated from lung, stomach, kidney, spleen, and mesenteric lymph node tissues. The hamsters had neither clinical signs nor lesions. However, 7 of 12 animals had low agglutinating antibody titers. The Syrian hamster can therefore be an asymptomatic carrier of C. kutscheri.",Aging
7989,"The induction of heat shock proteins (HSP) by cellular stress and the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis by physiologic stress are biological responses that aid in the maintenance of cellular and organismal homeostasis, respectively. In this report, restraint stress, known to activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, is shown to induce expression of HSP70 mRNA selectively in the adrenal cortex of the rat. Restraint-induced HSP70 expression in the adrenals is rapid and is preceded by the activation of a protein factor capable of binding to the heat shock transcriptional control element. The ability of restraint to induce HSP70 expression in the adrenal is virtually eliminated in hypophysectomized rats but can be restored by the exogenous administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone. The magnitude of this induction declines as a function of increasing age, which may contribute to a reduced stress tolerance by aged animals. These results support a role for HSP70 in the physiologic stress response mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.",Aging
7995,"We report the structure and regulation of a gene represented by clone pAT 133, which is induced upon transition from a resting state (G0) through the early phase of the cell cycle (G1). The pAT 133 gene is immediately induced, with FOS-like kinetics, in human T cells and in fibroblasts. Primary structure analysis showed that the encoded protein contains three tandem zinc-finger sequences of the type Cys2-Xaa12-His2. This zinc-finger region, which is thought to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner, is similar (greater than 80% on the amino acid level) to two previously described transcription factors pAT 225/EGR1 and pAT 591/EGR2. Except for the conserved zinc-finger domains, the amino acid sequences of the three proteins are distinct. This structural similarity suggests that the pAT 133 gene encodes a transcription factor with a specific biological function. Comparing the regulation of these related zinc-finger-encoding genes showed coordinate induction upon mitogenic stimulation of resting T lymphocytes and of resting fibroblasts. However, upon transition from a proliferating (G1) to a resting state of the cell cycle the three genes were differently regulated. In human histiocytic U937 cells mRNA of clone pAT 133 was constitutively expressed, whereas mRNA of pAT 225/EGR1 was induced upon induction of terminal differentiation. In contrast mRNA representing pAT 591/EGR2 was not expressed in these cells. This difference in gene regulation suggests distinct biological roles in the control of cell proliferation for the respective proteins.",Genes

Two approaches were compared for their effectiveness in isolating novel genes: random, vs differential, complementary DNA (cDNA) cloning methods. In the differential approach, only the cDNA clones containing rare sequences (as determined by preliminary clone hybridization) are further analyzed; in the random approach, cDNA clones are isolated at random from the cDNA library. More than two hundred cDNA clones altogether were analyzed, using a PCR-mediated amplification and sequencing strategy. A comparison of these sequences to nucleic acid and protein sequence databases, revealed that 84% of the isolated rare cDNA clones represented new, previously uncharacterized mouse genes. In contrast, less than 63% of the cDNA clones isolated at random from cDNA libraries, contained novel genes. Thus, the probability of isolating new, previously uncharacterized, mammalian genes from cDNA libraries can be markedly improved by focusing efforts on clones containing rare sequences.",Genes

In this region, the nucleotide sequence of the type 2 murine cDNA that we cloned was greater than 99% identical to the type 2 human cDNA but only 78% identical to the type 1 human cDNA. Hybridization to Southern blots containing DNA from all human chromosomes showed that gene 1 was found on chromosome 4, whereas gene 2 segregated to chromosome 10.

The data demonstrate that circulating ACTH rather than the corticosteroid plasma level was elevated under basal conditions and following stress. Furthermore, a reduction of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) number in the hippocampus and of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) number in the hypothalamus and the pituitary correspond to increased neuroendocrine responsiveness and negative feedback following stress. The changes in receptor binding do not parallel the changes in the amount of MR and GR mRNA measured with in situ hybridization. This suggests that the processing rather than the receptor gene expression is affected in senescence.",Aging

Sequencing the aberrant bands demonstrated the same C to T transition in all three unrelated patients, predicting substitution of a highly conserved threonine residue with a methionine in a membrane-spanning segment of this sodium channel protein. The observation of a distinct mutation that cosegregates with HYPP in two families and appears as a de novo mutation in a third establishes SCN4A as the HYPP gene.

8931,"Glucose-induced changes in cytoplasmic pH (pHi) were investigated using pancreatic beta-cells isolated from obese hyperglycemic mice. Glucose, at concentrations above 3-5 mM, depolarized the beta-cell and increased pHi, cytoplasmic free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), and insulin release. This increase in pHi was dependent on the presence of extracellular Na+ and was inhibited by 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride, a blocker of Na+/H+ exchange. Stimulation of protein kinase C with phorbol ester also induced an alkalinization. However, when protein kinase C activity was down-regulated, glucose stimulation still induced alkalinization. At 20 mM glucose, 10 mM NH4Cl induced a marked rise in pHi, paralleled by repolarization, inhibition of electrical activity, and decreases in both [Ca2+]i and insulin release. Reduction in [Ca2+]i was prevented by 200 microM tolbutamide, but not by 10 mM tetraethylammonium. At 4 mM glucose, NH4Cl induced a transient increase in insulin release, without changing [Ca2+]i. Exposure of beta-cells to 10 mM sodium acetate caused a persistent decrease in pHi, an effect paralleled by a small transient increase in [Ca2+]i. Acidification per se did not change the beta-cell sensitivity to glucose, not excluding that the activity of the ATP-regulated K+ channels may be modulated by changes in pHi.",Hydrogen-Ion Concentration
9174,"In this paper, the author notes the recommended definition of the word ""homology"" (i.e., indicating an ancestral relationship) and the recommended stipulation that ""evidence for homology should be explicitly laid out"". The postulated homology for somatic and testes-specific isozymes of cytochrome c is then examined, using recent data obtained from the study of cytochrome c genes. Consideration is also given to some newer findings of molecular biology and possibilities are considered for various types of change in the genome of an organism. Possible roles of introns, pseudogenes and multigene families are considered. The relationship of testes-specific cytochrome c to somatic cytochrome c is carefully considered from data obtained in experimental studies of genes of these two isozymes. If one assumes that these isozymes arose as a consequence of a gene duplication, data from rat and mouse genes indicate that the testes-specific isozyme has incorporated more amino acid changes than the somatic isozyme since the time of their divergence. However, when the 15 amino acid differences (testes-specific vs. somatic isozyme) are considered, there is virtually no similarity in these 15 positions of the testes-specific isozyme with any of the hypothetical ancestral sequences of the somatic isozyme. Nucleotide differences in cytochrome c genes have been evaluated by comparing genes for the two rodent cytochrome c isozymes to cytochrome c genes of fruit flies, chickens and humans. Comparisons of nucleotide substitution rates in genes for the two cytochrome c isozymes in rodents confirm the conclusions from amino acid sequence comparisons; namely, that more rapid nucleotide changes have occurred in the testes-specific cytochrome c gene, than in the somatic cytochrome c gene. Possible explanations for these findings are considered.",Genes

The physiopathogenesis from both the electrophysiological and pharmacological aspects is discussed in the framework of a concept according to which GRFD is considered as a malignant derivative of an existing slow spike-wave mechanism, due to the permanent or momentary breakdown of the GABA-ergic inhibitory process. In observations performed on some patients we found a paradoxical GRFD-eliciting effect of BDZ drugs and hexobarbiturate after chronic treatment with BDZ agents and/or barbiturate, and a GRFD-blocking effect of Anexate (Flumazenil), a BDZ antagonist on the pattern, appearing either spontaneously in slow-wave sleep or elicited by diazepam or barbiturate. Our findings support the assumption that BDZ (Barbiturate) GABA-Chloride Ionophore Complex plays an important role, both in the development of and possibly in the therapeutic approach to, the GRFD phenomena. Some hypotheses about the role played by the complex based on these observations are put forward.",Electroencephalography
9540,"Seizure propagation was studied with different seizure models induced by a kainic acid (KA) microinjection in nonanesthetized cats. These seizures were characterized with a focal onset of seizures followed by secondarily generalized seizures. The mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF) played an important role when an epileptogenic focus was located in a unilateral amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus or visual cortex. When the focus was located in a unilateral lateral geniculate body, a fast, synchronous and bidirectional propagation was observed in the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) and MRF. Brain stem seizure (generalized tonic seizure) was elicited by the KA injection into MRF. The EEG of generalized seizure was characterized by the propagations of seizure activities of MRF immediately to the bilateral SMC and thalamus. The results suggested that MRF participated actively in the generalization of the KA-induced seizures.",Electroencephalography
9541,"Field potentials were recorded from the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats to examine the role of synaptic potentiation in the development of seizure susceptibility during rapid kindling. Kindling stimulations (10 Hz for 10 sec) were delivered to the perforant path at every 5 min for 5 or 6 hrs. This procedure produced a sustained depression of excitatory synaptic transmission at the perforant path-granule cell synapse during and after kindling. However, the kindling procedure resulted in the prolongation of afterdischarges and the development of interictal discharges originated from granule cells, indicating an increase in the seizure susceptibility of these neurons. These results indicate that synaptic potentiation is not a critical requirement for an increase in seizure susceptibility during rapid kindling, even if it has a facilitating effect on the development of kindling as suggested in previous studies.",Electroencephalography
9570,"The human cholinesterase (ChE) gene from a patient with acholinesterasemia was cloned and analyzed. By using ChE cDNA as a probe, four independent clones were isolated from a genomic library constructed from the patient's DNA. Sequencing analysis of all of the four clones revealed that exon 2 of the ChE gene was disrupted by a 342-base-pair (bp) insertion of Alu element, including a poly(A) tract of 38 bp, which showed 93% sequence homology with a current type of human Alu consensus sequence. Southern blot analysis showed that the Alu insertion occurred in both alleles of the patient and was inherited in the patient's family. This Alu insertion was flanked by 15-bp of target site duplication in exon 2 corresponding to positions 1062-1076 of ChE cDNA, indicating that an Alu element could have been integrated by retrotransposition. Thus, this case provides an important clue to the mechanism of inactivation of a gene by integration of a retrotransposon.",Genes
9593,The present study is devoted to the analysis of changes of bioelectrical and vegetative indices at mental reproduction of emotional states by man. Analysis is conducted of the data of mapping of intracortical interactions depending on the dynamics of R-R interval changes. Two stages of mental reproduction of emotions are revealed which are characterized by the presence of different centers of integration--in the frontal and temporal parts of the brain cortex. It is shown that at maximum emotional stress the integration center shifts from the frontal regions to the temporal region of the left hemisphere.,Electroencephalography

9616,"Familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency is a hereditary disorder with clinical manifestations including corneal opacity, premature atherosclerosis and renal failure. In this study, we analyzed the molecular base underlying a case of Japanese LCAT deficiency, in which both LCAT mass and activity of the proband were nearly absent. DNA blot hybridization analysis showed no gross rearrangement in the LCAT gene of the proband. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned LCAT gene demonstrated only an extra nucleotide ""C"" insertion at the first exon, when compared to the sequence of wild type. This single base insertion caused a shift of the following reading frame, probably resulting in a truncated abnormal LCAT polypeptide that consist of only 16 amino acids. The direct sequence analysis of PCR-amplified DNA showed only the same insertion, indicating that the LCAT-deficient proband is a homozygote for the mutant allele. These results indicate that the clinical and biochemical feature of the patient is mainly caused by a complete deficiency of the enzyme based on a homozygous abnormality of LCAT gene.",Genes
10104,"Human recombinant interleukin-2 and rat recombinant IL-2 microinjected into the locus coeruleus of rats, induced typical dose-dependent behavioural sedation and/or sleep and electrocortical synchronization. During sleep induced by this lymphokine a dose-dependent increase in total voltage power (0.25-16 Hz) as well as in the 0.25-3, 3-6 and 6-9 Hz frequency bands was observed. The behavioural and electrocortical effects of interleukin-2 were blocked in animals pretreated with anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibodies and with naloxone, whereas they were still evident in rats pretreated with yohimbine. In addition, the behavioural and electrocortical slow-wave sleep effects observed after the administration of interleukin-2 into the locus coeruleus were reduced significantly or antagonized completely by a previous pretreatment with pertussis toxin, forskolin, dibutyryl-cyclic-AMP and 8-bromo-cyclic-AMP. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the behavioural and electrocortical changes of this lymphokine are mediated at locus coeruleus level via a guanine regulatory Gi protein coupling IL-2 specific receptors to the adenylate cyclase system.",Electroencephalography
10520,"This study characterizes the correlation between intracellular pH (pHi) and the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in suspended and adherent human epidermoid A-431 cells. Using the fluorescent dyes 2,7-bis(carboxyethyl)carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF) and fura-2, the resting pHi and [Ca2+]i in suspended cells were 7.23 +/- 0.03 and 209 +/- 30 nM; those in adherent cells were 7.28 +/- 0.02 and 87 +/- 5 nM. Removal of external Ca2+ did not change the resting pHi but reduced the resting [Ca2+]i, indicating the resting level of [Ca2+]i is in part maintained by an influx of Ca2+ from the external medium. When both suspended and adherent cells were acidified or alkalinized, resting [Ca2+]i was altered. An intracellular acidification induced a fall in [Ca2+]i, and a rise in pHi induced a rise in [Ca2+]i. These changes in [Ca2+]i were correlated with an uptake of 45Ca2+ from the external medium, whereas no Ca2+ efflux occurred. The alteration in [Ca2+]i induced by modification of pHi was abolished in the absence of external Ca2+ or by adding 2 mM CoCl2, LaCl3, and attenuated by the addition of 2 mM MnCl2 to the bathing medium. It was insensitive to the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blockers nifedipine or verapamil (1 mM). CoCl2, LaCl3, and MnCl2 each induced changes in pHi and [Ca2+]i but verapamil and nifedipine did not. Because CoCl2, LaCl3, and MnCl2 are also known to block Na+/Ca2+ exchange, intracellular Na+ ([Na+]i) was measured by flame photometry in acidified or alkalinized cells. In either case no change in [Na+]i was observed. Furthermore, treatment with amiloride (100 microM), a blocker of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, did not inhibit the pH-induced changes in [Ca2+]i. 1,2-bis(o-Aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) (100 microM), a Ca2+ chelator, induced a decrease in pHi as well as a reduction of [Ca2+]i, also supporting the direct relation between pHi and [Ca2+]i. 3,4,5-Trimethoxybenzoic acid 8-(diethylamino)ocytl ester HCl (TMB-8) (100 microM), a known blocker of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, did not change the resting pHi and [Ca2+]i in normal cells or cells acidified or alkalinized. This observation, taken together with data from cells incubated in the absence of external Ca2+, suggests intracellular Ca2+ pools are not involved in changes in [Ca2+]i that result from a modification of pHi. Resting pHi and [Ca2+]i in cells treated with either 8-bromo-dibutyryl cAMP (1 mM) or forskolin (150 microM) are not changed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",Hydrogen-Ion Concentration
10546,"Human articular cartilages of various ages were digested with collagenase, and the fluorescence of the digests was measured as a function of age. At acidic pH, all collagenase-treated fractions were found to contain two main fluorophores with fluorescence maxima at 395 and 385 nm (excitation at 295 and 335 nm, respectively). Each fluorophore was isolated from the hydrolysate and its structure was deduced from spectral and chemical data. The 395/295 nm fluorophore was identified as pyridinoline, which is one of the non-reducible cross-linkages in collagen. The 385/335 nm fluorophore was identical to pentosidine, which was isolated from human dura mater and characterized by Sell and Monnier in 1989. Our results showed that the amount of pentosidine per collagen in human articular cartilage increases linearly with age (r = 0.929, p less than 0.005), while the amount of pyridinoline per collagen remained constant and was not correlated with age (r = 0.20). On the other hand, the amount of pentosidine per pyridinoline increased exponentially during life (r2 = 0.839, p less than 0.05).",Aging
11306,The human nervous system's lability was studied with the aid of critic fusion frequency (CFF). The CFF was compared with the mean level of asymmetry of the EEG waves' fronts (MLA).

11521,"Microspectrofluorometry was used to study the regulation of intracellular pH (pHi) in 2'-7'-bis (carboxyethyl-)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF)-loaded astrocytes. They rapidly regulated an acid transient induced by an NH4+ prepulse. This back regulation was blocked by removal of Na+, or by addition of amiloride, but was also inhibited when extracellular pH (pHe) was lowered. Furthermore, when cells were exposed to HEPES buffer with reduced or increased pHe, pHi changed in parallel. Thus, although the cells possess an efficient H+ extrusion mechanism they fail to regulate pHi to a normal value unless pHe is held constant. The results challenge the concept of a H+ regulatory site at the internal side of the exchanger regulating pHi to a constant value.",Hydrogen-Ion Concentration

12449,"A study was carried out on cell-mediated immunity in healthy persons and patients with tuberculosis in order to extend the diagnostic capacity in tuberculosis. We studied the relation between baciloscopy and the state of specific cell-mediated immunity in vivo (Mantoux) and in vitro (leukocyte migration inhibition assay with PPD-RT 23 to evaluate specific cell-mediated immunity and PHA to evaluate nonspecific immunity) in 131 patients with active tuberculosis, in 63 patients with chronic tuberculosis, in 62 healthy persons and 10 individuals living with tuberculosis patients. The results demonstrate that the percentage of reaction was very low in both tests, being of no statistical significance the difference between patients with active or with chronic tuberculosis, although it was significant in the control group. In about half of the patients with active tuberculosis a positive baciloscopy could be observed; the percentage was much lower in patients suffering from chronic tuberculosis, the difference between the two groups significant from a statistical point of view. At the same time when we carried out an evolutionary study in 10 patients with positive baciloscopy, we observed a slight capacity of conversion of immunity when the baciloscopy was negative.","Immunity, Cellular"

12897,"Molecular chaperones help other proteins in their correct folding and assembly. We have cloned the genes, cpn60 and dnaK, which encode proteins belonging to the chaperonin-60 and the 70-kDa heat shock protein families from the transformable cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. These genes are present in single copies in the genome, and the major transcripts for each gene are monocistronic. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences reveals that cyanobacterial chaperonin-60 is equally homologous to bacterial and plant chaperonin-60 proteins while the product of dnaK is more similar to its bacterial homologues than to its eukaryotic counterparts. The DNA fragments sequenced in these studies also contain five other open reading frames. One of them, ORF60-5, encodes a protein whose deduced amino acid sequence shows remarkable similarity to those of a family of peripheral membrane proteins involved in metabolite transport in bacteria. The transcript levels of dnaK and cpn60 of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 increase in response to stress conditions such as heat shock, ultraviolet exposure, and oxidative stress. This is one of the first examples of cyanobacterial gene expression being regulated by environmental stresses.",Genes
12919,"The authors compared the pharmacodynamics of sufentanil with those of fentanyl using the electroencephalogram (EEG) as a measure of opioid drug effect. Sixteen patients were given a rapid infusion of sufentanil (18.75 micrograms/min) during EEG recording. To quantitate the opioid-induced slowing of the EEG, the authors analyzed its power spectrum and calculated the spectral edge. An inhibitory sigmoid Emax model of the maximal decrease in spectral edge produced by the opioid related spectral edge values to serum concentrations of sufentanil. The resulting data for the pharmacodynamic parameters of sufentanil were compared with fentanyl parameters that were obtained by reanalysis from an identically conducted, previously published study. The half-time of blood-brain equilibration (T1/2Keo) was not statistically different between sufentanil and fentanyl (6.2 +/- 2.8 vs. 6.6 +/- 1.7 min, mean +/- SD, respectively). The intrinsic potency of sufentanil, as measured by the serum concentration needed to cause half the maximal EEG slowing (IC50), was 12-fold greater (0.68 +/- 0.31 ng/ml) than that of fentanyl (8.1 +/- 2.2 ng/ml). The second part of the study verified the hypothesis that administration of equipotent bolus doses would produce equal onset times. Bolus injections of either 125 micrograms of sufentanil or 1,250 micrograms of fentanyl were given during EEG recording. The time from injection to 50% maximal EEG slowing (T50) was calculated for each patient. The values for T50 for the two groups did not differ. The authors conclude that fentanyl and sufentanil have similar pharmacodynamic profiles, the former being 12 times more potent than the latter.",Electroencephalography
12945,"The antimurine CD2 mAb 12-15 was administered intravenously to investigate the role of CD2 in cell-mediated immunity in vivo. The anti-CD2 mAb was able to diminish the contact sensitivity response to the hapten trinitrophenyl and was most effective when administered during the efferent or elicitative phase of immunity. Antibody treatment was also able to inhibit in vivo priming for subsequent generation of secondary, TNP-specific CTL in vitro. This inhibitory effect was most effective in the afferent or early phase of immunity. Indeed antibody could be injected at least 3 weeks prior to in vivo antigen priming, and the subsequent CTL response was still suppressed. Additional experiments showed a well-defined dose-response relationship between the amount of anti-CD2 administered and subsequent immunosuppression. Control experiments showed that other isotype-matched antibodies were not suppressive and that the anti-CD2 was not merely shifting the kinetics of the CTL response. Further experiments revealed that in vivo mAb treatment could also inhibit the subsequent development of primary, alloantigen-specific CTL in vitro while the mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) remained unchanged. FACS analysis revealed a marked downmodulation of CD2 in vivo, a small and variable decrease in CD8, and essentially no change in CD3 or CD4 after treatment with anti-CD2. The F(ab')2 fragment was not able to downmodulate CD2 or to suppress CTL activity at the doses tested. These results support a major role for CD2 in diverse aspects of cell-mediated immunity affecting both CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells. The anti-CD2 mAb functions not by deleting or depleting relevant cell populations but rather by altering the array of cell surface receptors and subsequent responses to antigenic challenge.","Immunity, Cellular"
13038,"Glutamine synthetase (EC 6.3.1.2) gene evolution in various animals, plants, and bacteria was evaluated by a general stationary Markov model. The evolutionary process proved to be unexpectedly regular even for a time span as long as that between the divergence of prokaryotes from eukaryotes. This enabled us to draw phylogenetic trees for species whose phylogeny cannot be easily reconstructed from the fossil record. Our calculation of the times of divergence of the various organelle-specific enzymes led us to hypothesize that the pea and bean chloroplast genes for these enzymes originated from the duplication of nuclear genes as a result of the different metabolic needs of the various species. Our data indicate that the duplication of plastid glutamine synthetase genes occurred long after the endosymbiotic events that produced the organelles themselves.",Genes
13134,"It has recently been proposed that sequence variation in the gene coding for tissue kallikrein might be involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. However, molecular evidence of an association between a sequence alteration in the kallikrein gene family and the transmission of increased blood pressure has never been reported. In 32 recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and the normotensive Brown Norway rat (BN), we investigated whether a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) marking the kallikrein gene family cosegregated with blood pressure. In the RI strains that inherited the kallikrein RFLP from the SHR progenitor strain, the median systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures were significantly greater than in the RI strains that inherited the kallikrein RFLP from the BN progenitor strain. These findings suggest that in the rat, sequence variation in the kallikrein gene family, or in closely linked genes, may have the capacity to affect blood pressure.",Genes
13177,"Two gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase mRNAs (mRNAI and mRNAII), with alternate 5'-untranslated regions, are expressed in the rat kidney. Oligonucleotides were designed based upon these two alternate 5' sequences and used as primers to amplify GGT genomic DNA sequences. The genomic organization of the mRNAI and mRNAII 5'-untranslated sequences reveals that the mRNAs are encoded from two separate promoters which are 2.1 kbp apart on the single GGT gene. A 2775 base pair genomic sequence, which contains the proximal GGT promoter, was cloned from two overlapping amplified fragments. S1 mapping analysis shows that the kidney GGT mRNAI is transcribed from several start sites on this promoter which displays neither a classical TATA box nor Sp1 binding sites. Chimeric plasmids, including the GGT promoter region for mRNAI, associated with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene, were transiently expressed in a kidney (LLCPK) and in a hepatoma (HTC) cell line. A sequence extending 308 bases upstream from the major GGT mRNAI start site drives a promoter activity which is 5-fold higher in LLCPK than in HTC cells and is sufficient to confer cell specificity to the GGT proximal promoter.",Genes
13276,"(1) We assayed active and total (i.e. active plus succinylated) 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase in mitochondria isolated from foetal, neonatal, suckling or weaned rats. (2) HMG-CoA synthase was substantially succinylated and inactivated in mitochondria isolated from term-foetal, (1-h-old, 6-h-old, 1-day-old) neonatal, suckling and high carbohydrate/low-fat (hc)-weaned rats. Succinylation of HMG-CoA synthase was very low in mitochondria isolated from the livers of foetal, 30-min-old neonatal and high-fat/carbohydrate-free (hf)-weaned rats. (3) There was a negative correlation between active HMG-CoA synthase and succinyl-CoA content in mitochondria isolated from term-foetal, suckling and hc-weaned rats. (4) Differences in active enzyme could not be entirely accounted for by differences in succinylation and inactivation of the synthase. Immunoassay confirmed that the absolute amounts of mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase increased during the foetal/neonatal transition and decreased with hc weaning. The levels remained elevated with hf weaning. (5) From these data we propose that mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase is controlled by two different mechanisms in young rats. Regulation by succinylation provides a mechanism for rapid modification of existing enzyme in response to changing metabolic states. Changes in the absolute amounts of HMG-CoA synthase provide a more long-term control in response to nutritional changes.",Aging

No correlation between IIS and SSLI in CA4, CA3, CA1, or the dentate was evident. This finding suggests a role of the EC in generation, regulation, or expression of interictal paroxysmal electrical activity in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), for which somatostatin may be a marker.",Electroencephalography
13621,"The role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mediating pulmonary clearance of a cryptococcal infection was investigated. Intratracheal inoculation of BALB/c and C.B-17 mice with a moderately virulent strain of Cryptococcus neoformans (52D) resulted in a pulmonary infection, which was cleared by a T cell-dependent mechanism. During this clearance, there was a significant influx of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the lungs. Depletion of CD4+ T cells by injections of CD4-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) prevented pulmonary clearance and also resulted in significant colonization of the brain and spleen of infected mice. CD4 depletion did not prevent the influx of CD8+ T cells into the lungs. Surprisingly, depletion of CD8+ T cells by mAb also ablated pulmonary clearance. CD8-depleted mice also had a small but significant increase in brain and spleen colony-forming unit compared to control mice by the end of the study. CD4+ T cell pulmonary influx was independent of the presence of CD8+ T cells. The lungs of T cell-depleted mice were examined histologically. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells each mediated a degree of inflammatory influx seen in the lungs of infected mice and raised the possibility that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may synergize to generate the inflammatory response in the lungs. Numerous phagocytized but intact cryptococci were seen in the inflammatory foci of CD8-depleted mice but not in control or CD4-depleted mice. We propose that CD4+ T cells may recruit and activate effector phagocytes while CD8+ T cells predominantly function to lyse cryptococcus-laden unactivated phagocytes similar to the function of CD8+ T cells during listeria and mycobacteria infections.","Immunity, Cellular"
13622,"Spleen cells from CBA/J mice immunized with mouse thyroglobulin (MTg) and the adjuvant lipopolysaccharide induce experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT) after transfer to recipient mice if they are first activated in vitro with MTg. EAT induced by cells cultured with MTg is generally moderate in severity and is characterized by a thyroid infiltration consisting primarily of mononuclear cells. Addition of the anti-interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) M7/20, 3C7, or 7D4 to spleen cell cultures with MTg resulted in a cell population capable of inducing a more severe type of EAT characterized by extensive follicular destruction, granuloma formation, and the presence of multinucleated giant cells. Recipients of cells cultured with MTg and anti-IL-2R mAb also had higher anti-MTg autoantibody responses than recipients of cells cultured with MTg alone. Activation of cells capable of transferring severe granulomatous EAT and increased anti-MTg autoantibody responses required both MTg and M7/20 in culture and required addition of M7/20 within the first 8 h of the 72-h culture period. CD4+ T cells were required for the expression of both the severe granulomatous EAT lesions and the mononuclear cell infiltrates typically observed in murine EAT. The increased anti-MTg autoantibody responses in recipients of cells cultured with MTg and anti-IL-2R mAbs were not restricted to a particular immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass and included antibody of the IgG1, IgG2A, and IgG2B subclasses. These results suggest that a subset of CD4+ T cells capable of inducing severe granulomatous EAT and increased anti-MTg autoantibody responses is preferentially activated when cells are cultured in the presence of anti-IL-2R mAb. Anti-IL-2R mAb may either prevent activation of cells that induce classical lymphocytic EAT or prevent activation of cells that normally function to downregulate EAT effector T cell activity.","Immunity, Cellular"

Radiolabeled DNA from one YAC clone identified two distinct allele-specific alterations that cosegregated with the lin-29 mutant phenotype in lin-29 intragenic recombinants. lin-29 sequences were severely under-represented in all cosmid and lambda libraries tested, but were readily cloned in a YAC vector, suggesting that the lin-29 region contains sequences incompatible with standard prokaryotic cloning techniques.",Genes

To identify genes controlling cell fate in the Drosophila central nervous system, we screened for mutations that alter expression of homeobox genes in the developing central nervous system (indicating changes in cell fates).

The prospero gene was discovered in both screens. prospero is expressed in a subset of neuroblasts, sensory neuron precursors, and identified glial precursors. It is not expressed in neurons. Neuroblasts lacking prospero function generate abnormal cell lineages, producing incorrectly specified progeny that differentiate into neurons showing axon pathfinding defects. prospero is therefore a novel type of gene expressed in neuroblasts and known to specify neuronal fate.",Genes
